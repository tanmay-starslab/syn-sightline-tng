1. [Scientific Python documentation guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/docs/) - Focused on creating docs using Sphinx with Myst (markdown)
2. [PyOpenSci documentation guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/documentation/index.html) - Worth reading for a different perspective on writing documentation, with more focus on the why and how. Uses Sphinx, but this is not the core part of the documentaiton.
